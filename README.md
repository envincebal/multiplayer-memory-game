## Project Overview
Built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. This multiplayer memory game has a large emphasis on DOM manipulation. Users can choose between number or icons, a 4x4 or 6x6 grid and single or multiplayer. If single player is chosen, user will race against time to win the game as quick as possible and with the lowest number of moves as possible. If multiplayer is chosen, players can compete against one another to see who gets the most matches at the end.
